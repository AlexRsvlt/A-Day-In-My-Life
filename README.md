# A-Day-In-My-Life

"A Day in My Life" is an interactive terminal-based adventure game where players guide the main character through morning and midday choices. Each decision affects a mood score, leading to different endings that reflect the player’s actions. The game uses Python’s input() for player interaction, conditional branching for story paths, and a mood tracking system to make choices impactful."
